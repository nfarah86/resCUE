motivation:


everything we do= we believe in challenging the status quo; think differently; beautiful design, user-friendly; good computers..want to buy one?

reverse order: people buy why you do it....

WHY-> HOW -> WHAT

PEOPLE BUY WHY YOU DO IT!

people who believe in what you believe...... buyology. 

neocortext- > language; hardcore..doens't drive behaviour

limbic - feeling; trust' loayalt; decision making; no capacity for language... controls behaviour..gut decisions come from;.... ' doesn't feel right.

sell to people who believe what you believe....

hire people who believe in what you believe...exp wright brothers

samuel langly: 50k given $ for flying machine; worked at simthsonian; hired best minds; market conditin good;  why we never heard of him

dayton ohio: wright brothers; no $/ self-funded/ no college education...difference: driven buy a cause; belief.  IF they can figure out the flying machine ----they cna change the world..

langley:driven by $... that's why he got no where.....

dec 17: wright took flight

langley: quit as soon as wright brothers took off dec 17th....

/..

mlk : told him what he believe...people took that ... what people believed in america... they didn't come for mlk, they came for themselves. 

leaders vs. 

those who lead.... INSPIRE is the difference.... we want to follow them; for ourselves.. START WITH WHY.... inspire those around them.


what's your cause/ belief/ why should anyone care...?

we make computers; uesr firendly; buy one ? bad

say what we do/ how we are different/ buy car

...

why: everything we do we beleive in challn status quo.. think differently

way: making beautfiul design..

what: happen to maek greate cmputers...


reverse orders.

initial greeting.... When they ask how you are? this is where I lead in:

why lead in:

I'm great and I'm so excited to show you my product! This product was initially inspired to empower myself in case if I was put in a dreadful situation. Have you or do you know someone who wished that they had a 'something' to let someone know where they are or if they are in trouble? (wait fo them to answer) then lead in..... :


I have: I'm a runner and when I was  training at night, I got scared.  I was afraid someone was following me, which led me to run home.I had my phone on me, however,  I was afraid that would be too obvious and I can be easily over powered.  At that time, I wished that there was a product that would be discreet and easily accessible to the user.  After I got accepted to hackbright, I decided to pursue this idea to actual reality.  Currently, I have a product that is at least 2.5 times faster compared to logging into a phone and sending various text messages. The goal of this product is to be user-friendly, have an inconspicuous design, and be fast and reliable. 

how:

The way I accomplish this is two folds:  hardware and software.  I have a bluetooth LE microcontroller with a push button called the 'bean'.  I've programmed the bean to send serial data to a native obj-c app that I've also coded.  The way the microcontroller interacts with the app is by sending 'packets of data' that the app is coded to understand.  The code for the microcontroller detects when the button state has changed.  Based on that information, it sends an "S" for a short, instantaneous press, and an "L" for a long press that's greater tha 2.5 secs. I've programmed the iphone app to execute several tasks based on if the signal is an "S" or an "L".  In addition to this, I've programmed that app to get the user's current gps location.  All this information is sent to the flask/python webserver as an HTTP request.  The data that is being sent is in a json object.  The webserver coded in python and javascript,  takes this information and sends a twilio API call.  The type of text message sent is based on how long the button is pressed on the microcontroller.  I can actually demo this for you now!

....demo... end with ...

I took my fear a few months ago and decided to build a product that can hopefully help me and other persons in dire situations.  (..something along those lines...)
